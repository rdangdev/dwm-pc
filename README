# dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
customised by rdang.dev
version: 6.2(6.3 is bloat)

## Patch List
------------
check commit list for now. WIP

## Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
Polybar requires more dependencies:
polybar dwm module - https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-dwm-module
sxhkd - for setting keybindings


## Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


## Running dwm
-----------
enter this into your .xinitrc to automatically run it in a loop(let's you refresh config on the fly)
    while :; do
        /usr/local/bin/dwm >/dev/null 2>&1
    done

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)
